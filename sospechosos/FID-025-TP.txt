Modern intelligent vehicles are equipped with numerous functional sensors. Many Artificial Intelligence-based foundation models have been developed for smart sensing, aiming to recognize known object classes in new but similar scenarios. However, detecting all object classes in both familiar and unfamiliar scenarios remains a challenge for these foundation models. This letter seeks to advance smart sensing research for intelligent vehicles. It begins by summarizing the currently widely-used foundation models and the foundational intelligence required for the smart sensing of intelligent vehicles. Next, it introduces Sora-based Parallel Vision, a method designed to enhance the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and ultimately to generalized intelligence (3.0). Several representative case studies are presented to illustrate the potential applications of Sora-based Parallel Vision, followed by a discussion of its future research directions.
