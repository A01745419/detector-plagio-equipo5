In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have garnered significant attention in various engineering and practical applications due to their unique characteristics and operational flexibility. Effective control systems are essential for UAVs to function properly and efficiently. A promising control technique is visual servoing, which uses onboard camera systems to inspect the UAV's environment and autonomously control its operations. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly employed in the visual servoing of autonomous UAV applications. Despite the growing research in AI-based visual control of UAV systems, comprehensive review articles that highlight general trends and future directions in this field are scarce. This work thoroughly examines the application and advancements of AI-enhanced visual servoing in autonomous UAV systems, addressing critical control tasks and providing insights into future research directions to enhance performance and applicability, which are currently underrepresented in the literature. The paper first reviews the application of intelligent visual servoing systems for autonomously performing various UAV control tasks, including 3D UAV positioning, aerial and ground object following, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous landing. It then discusses and analyzes the research advancements in applying AI techniques to the visual servoing of autonomous UAV systems. Finally, it outlines future directions and identifies critical research gaps for further improving the performance and applicability of intelligent visual servoing systems.
