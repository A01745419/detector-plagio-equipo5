This paper addresses the asymmetric face recognition problem where the number of names in a name list and the number of faces in a photo may not be equal, yet each face needs to be automatically labeled with a name. This issue arises because many meetings in the past have resulted in group photos, accompanied by a name list of participants without specific face-to-name labels. Complicating matters, group photos might include faces of non-participants or exclude participants who helped take the pictures. To tackle this, the paper proposes an asymmetric face recognition mechanism, termed AFRM. Initially, AFRM uses the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect and extract all faces from photos. It then extracts features from each face using the convolution feature map (Conv_FF) and classifies the faces into different groups. Subsequently, AFRM employs a statistic-based mechanism to map each name on the list to a face group, ensuring that each face is assigned a name. For quick face identification during meetings, AFRM utilizes K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to represent the features of each face. During new meetings, AFRM can extract a face's feature and use KNN to identify the features. Experimental results indicate that the proposed mechanism achieves over 97% accuracy without requiring one-to-one name and face labeling.
