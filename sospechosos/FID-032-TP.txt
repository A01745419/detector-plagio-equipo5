How would people distribute the risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic? The extensive literature on the ethics of AVs primarily focuses on moral judgments in unavoidable collision scenarios. We propose broadening the discussion to include driving behaviors in everyday road traffic, where continuous ethical questions arise due to the constant redistribution of risk among road users. This redistribution raises ethically significant questions that cannot be addressed by simple heuristics like “hitting the brakes.” Using an interactive, graphical representation of different traffic situations, we gauged participants’ preferences on AV driving maneuvers through a representative survey in Germany. Our participants' preferences significantly deviated from mere collision avoidance. Interestingly, participants were willing to assume risks themselves for the benefit of other road users, suggesting that the social dilemma of AVs might be mitigated in risky environments. Our research could potentially bridge the gap between engineers and philosophers, fostering a more constructive discussion on the ethics of AVs.
