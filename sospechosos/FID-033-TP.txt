The future sustainability of the global automotive industry will be significantly influenced by the fourth industrial revolution and the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The “new normal” is expected to be shaped by emerging industry standards, including increasingly autonomous self-driving technology, updated safety standards, more complex insurance regulations, adaptive social resistance to technological change, city infrastructure requirements with a digital divide, and disruptive business innovations driven by strategic input supply partnerships with open-source AI. In this chapter, key factors of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are analyzed using AI advancements in radar and laser technology, commercial risk factors, self-driving consumer behavior, city infrastructure constraints, and social adaptations to new technology. The future trajectory of the AV industry is predicted to be influenced by the interplay of commercial, social, risk, infrastructure, and regulatory mechanisms, impacting various industry stakeholders. This study suggests that the most sustainable scenario for the AV industry will be driven by: (1) AI’s pulsed laser LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with adequate loop frequency and GPS bi-directional cloud technology, (2) pooled insurance as opposed to individual liability, (3) smart city infrastructure, which may exacerbate regional inequality due to a sharp digital divide across transport regions, and (4) customers who prefer human-controlled semi-autonomous vehicles over fully autonomous machines.
