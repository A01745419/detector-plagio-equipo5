Artificial intelligence has become an essential component for both production and service systems in recent years, as technology has become a crucial aspect of daily life. Automated driving vehicles, also known as driverless cars, can operate autonomously without a human driver. Research on autonomous vehicles has advanced significantly in recent years. Artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles are currently in high demand within society. Although some people might be hesitant to relinquish control of their vehicle to a computer, automated driving technologies have the potential to enhance road safety. Self-driving cars can address environmental and safety-related issues. Unlike humans, computers do not struggle to maintain attention while driving. Furthermore, by responding appropriately, an automated car can prevent accidents in potentially dangerous road situations. One of the many advantages of self-driving technology is making transportation more accessible to people who are unable to drive. Many individuals, due to inexperience, incapacity, or age, are unable to operate a vehicle. These individuals can travel much more safely and independently with autonomous vehicles. Therefore, in this chapter, we will explore the architectures of both the software and hardware of autonomous cars, as well as their components, benefits, and future developments.
