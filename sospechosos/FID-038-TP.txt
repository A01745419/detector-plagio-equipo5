Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as expert systems (ES), fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and biologically inspired (BI) approaches, have been widely applied in power electronics and motor drives in recent years. Each AI method possesses its own uniqueness and characteristics. A computational model of emotional learning in the mammalian brain, known as brain emotional learning-based intelligent controller (BELBIC), has been developed by researchers in recent times. The results have demonstrated BELBIC's capability to control unknown nonlinear dynamic systems. Consequently, BELBIC can be readily adopted for niche mechatronics and industrial applications.
