Humans possess innate social and emotional abilities that facilitate their interactions with others, including the capacity to discern the emotions of fellow humans. This ability significantly enriches human interactions. As we progress into an era marked by increasing Human-Machine Interaction systems, there arises a necessity to imbue our machines with these social and emotional capabilities through algorithmic means. A forefront area of research in emotion detection involves the recognition of emotions using facial images. The ability to perceive the emotions of individuals enables machines to adapt and tailor themselves to meet human needs and comfort levels. Emotion detection can be conducted through various modalities, such as video, audio, images, text, biometric information, and more. This study explores the evolving trends in emotion recognition via facial images. Automated emotion recognition of individuals holds the potential to anticipate psychiatric disorders or other latent mental health concerns.
