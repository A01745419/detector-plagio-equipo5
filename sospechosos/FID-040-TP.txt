Automated dialogue systems represent pivotal applications of artificial intelligence, yet conventional systems encounter challenges in comprehending user emotions and delivering empathetic responses. This study endeavors to incorporate emotional intelligence technology into automated dialogue systems, culminating in the development of a dialogue generation model infused with emotional intelligence leveraging deep learning and natural language processing techniques. The model demonstrates proficiency in discerning and comprehending a diverse spectrum of emotions and nuanced pain signals in real-time, thereby enabling the system to furnish empathetic interactions. By amalgamating insights from the research study "Can artificial intelligence detect pain and express pain empathy?", the model's capacity to grasp the subtle nuances of pain empathy has been bolstered, thus establishing elevated benchmarks for emotional intelligence dialogue systems. The project endeavors to furnish theoretical comprehension and pragmatic recommendations for integrating advanced emotional intelligence capabilities into dialogue systems, thereby augmenting user experience and interaction quality.
