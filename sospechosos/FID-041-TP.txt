Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated significant expectations about the future impact of AI in education and learning (AIED). Often, these expectations are based on misunderstandings of current technical capabilities, a lack of knowledge about the state-of-the-art AI in education, and overly narrow views on the roles of education in society. In this article, we provide a review of existing AI systems in education and their pedagogical and educational assumptions. We develop a typology of AIED systems and describe different ways of using AI in education and learning, demonstrating how these are grounded in various interpretations of what AI and education are or could be. Additionally, we discuss some potential roadblocks on the path to implementing AIED.
