This study conducted a content analysis of research aimed at uncovering how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in the education sector and exploring potential research trends and challenges in AI in education. A total of 100 papers, including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytical papers, were selected from the education and educational research category of the Social Sciences Citation Index database, spanning from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis revealed that the research questions could be classified into three layers: development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affective computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Furthermore, four research trends, including the Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for future investigation. However, challenges in education that may arise from AI were also proposed, such as the inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, and social and ethical issues. The results provide insights into the current state of AI in the education domain, helping to strengthen the theoretical foundation of AI in education and offering a promising avenue for educators and AI engineers to pursue further collaborative research.
