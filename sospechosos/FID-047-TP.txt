Technology has significantly advanced surgery, particularly minimally invasive surgery (MIS), including laparoscopic and robotic surgery. This progress has introduced numerous technologies into the operating room, providing additional information about surgical procedures, such as instrument usage and trajectories. Among these technologies, the data extracted from surgical videos captured by endoscopes is especially substantial. Thus, automating data analysis is crucial to reduce data complexity while maximizing its utility, opening new opportunities for research and development. Computer vision (CV) is the study of how computers can understand digital images or videos, aiming to automate tasks traditionally performed by the human visual system. This field encompasses a broad range of processes, from hardware for image sensing to AI-based image recognition. In recent years, AI-based image recognition for simple tasks, like recognizing snapshots, has advanced to a level comparable to human performance. Although recognizing surgical videos is more complex and challenging, its effective application to MIS could lead to significant surgical advancements, such as intraoperative decision-making support and image-guided surgery. Ultimately, this could pave the way for automated surgery. In this article, we summarize recent advances and future perspectives in AI-related research and development within the field of surgery.
