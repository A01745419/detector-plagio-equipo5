Surprisingly, the previously reported high accuracies, which exceeded 95%, significantly dropped when confronted with the more challenging conditions of the forensic scenario, plummeting to as low as 65%. Essentially, while facial recognition systems have demonstrated impressive performance under ideal conditions, our study indicates a substantial decrease in accuracy when faced with the complexities and challenges typical of real-world forensic scenarios, underscoring the need for further advancements to bridge this gap. Recent developments in machine learning and computer vision have shown that facial recognition systems can achieve accuracies that surpass human performance in controlled settings, yet fingerprint analysis has proven to be more accurate in all aspects. To investigate this, we developed a large-scale synthetic facial dataset and designed a controlled facial lineup that replicates conditions encountered in real forensic situations. This method allowed us to systematically assess facial recognition under various challenging real-world conditions. Utilizing both our synthetic dataset and a well-known dataset of actual faces, we evaluated the accuracy of two widely used neural-based facial recognition systems. A comparative and analytical method was applied for this research. Artificial intelligence could assist humans in enhancing accuracy and expediting the investigation process.
