With the advent of deep neural networks, the performance of biometric systems has increased tremendously. Biometric systems for face recognition are now utilized in everyday life, such as in border control, crime prevention, or personal device access control. Although the accuracy of face recognition systems is typically high, they are not without flaws. Many biometric systems have been found to exhibit demographic bias, resulting in different demographic groups not being recognized with the same accuracy. This is particularly true for facial recognition due to demographic factors, such as gender and skin color. While many previous works have already reported demographic bias, this study aims to reduce demographic bias in biometric face recognition applications. In this context, 12 face recognition systems are benchmarked concerning biometric recognition performance as well as demographic differentials, i.e., fairness. Subsequently, various fusion techniques are employed to enhance fairness compared to single systems. The experimental results indicate that it is possible to improve fairness concerning single demographics, such as skin color or gender, although improving fairness for demographic subgroups proves to be more challenging.
