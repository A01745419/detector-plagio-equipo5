The chapter discusses how digital technology can promote peacebuilding through education while recognizing the potential benefits and risks associated with its use. The authors propose an approach based on human-centered design (HCD) that prioritizes the needs and perspectives of learners. Three case studies are presented in the chapter, demonstrating the potential of digital storytelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and gaming to support peacebuilding. The first case study explores the use of digital storytelling to teach about genocide, while the second focuses on the use of AI to protect victims of violence. The third case study discusses the use of gaming to raise awareness of war. The authors acknowledge that each technology represents a complex field of inquiry and offer exercises in imagination to explore the possibilities of liberatory design. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the ambivalent nature of technology and its potential for both conflict and peacebuilding.
