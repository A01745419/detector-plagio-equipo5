In the realm of modern intelligent vehicles, a myriad of functional sensors have been strategically installed to facilitate their operations. These sensors serve as the backbone of the vehicle's intelligence, enabling it to perceive and interpret its surroundings accurately. Numerous Artificial Intelligence-based foundation models have surfaced, each aiming to enhance smart sensing capabilities by identifying familiar object classes even in novel and analogous scenarios. Despite these advancements, the foundational models of smart sensing still grapple with the challenge of effectively detecting all object classes across both familiar and unfamiliar environments.
This letter endeavors to push the boundaries of smart sensing research within the domain of intelligent vehicles. It begins by providing an overview of the current landscape of widely-used foundation models and the foundational intelligence necessary for proficient smart sensing in intelligent vehicles. Subsequently, it elucidates the concept of Sora-based Parallel Visionâ€”a groundbreaking approach designed to elevate foundation models of smart sensing from their rudimentary intelligence (1.0) to a state of heightened intelligence (2.0) and ultimately to attain generalized intelligence (3.0). To illustrate the potential applications of Sora-based Parallel Vision, a series of illustrative case studies are presented, showcasing its versatility and efficacy. Finally, the letter outlines future research directions aimed at further advancing the capabilities of Sora-based Parallel Vision in the realm of smart sensing for intelligent vehicles.
