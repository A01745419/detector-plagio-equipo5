A global labor shortage is being experienced by charitable organizations. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been employed to help combat the shortage, however, the scope and limits of AI fundraisers are still unclear, calling for further investigation. To improve their understanding of AI fundraisers, 654 adults were recruited from an online crowdsourcing platform for this study, and six chatbot agents were developed (emotional vs. factual Ã— no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image). First, an independent samples t-test was employed to examine the effect of chatbots' conversational style on willingness to donate to Ukraine war victims. The mediating roles (independent and serial) of perceived humanness and empathy toward victims in the relationship between chatbots' emotional expression and willingness to donate were also tested by conducting a serial multiple mediation analysis. Finally, the moderating role of visual cues (no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image) was tested by conducting a moderated serial multiple mediation analysis. The results revealed that emotional chatbots yield a higher willingness to donate, and perceived humanness and empathy toward victims mediate this relationship independently and serially. However, the results suggest that visual cues did not significantly moderate the relationship between chatbot agents' emotional expression on willingness to donate.
