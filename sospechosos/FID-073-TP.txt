The application of artificial intelligence for detecting emotions in neuromarketing is the subject of this paper. The goal is to enable the identification of user emotions through a webcam, using convolutional neural networks. The first part of the paper describes the neural networks, the basic types, and their differences, with the greatest attention given to the description and application of convolutional neural networks. A Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN, is specialized in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. User emotion recognition is enabled using the face-api.js library, which implements the following models: SSD Mobilenet V1, Tiny Face Detector, and MTCNN. Tiny Face Detector, used in the application, is a model for real-time face detection with small size, speed, and moderate resource consumption, compatible with the web and mobile platforms. In the second part of the paper, an application was developed, utilizing the face-api.js library to detect emotions, as a tool to support neuromarketing research. It allows the marketer to create research to analyze advertising material, displaying advertising content and collecting data while watching. Data is stored and graphically displayed to the marketer. This section describes in detail how the detection process works. Evaluation was made in the third part of the paper, performed by experiment. The results show that the emotions of the user can be recognized by the developed system, with a satisfactory level of precision. The advertising content has previously entered parameters, representing the desired results. By comparing these parameters and the obtained results, the marketer decides whether the advertisement is successful.
