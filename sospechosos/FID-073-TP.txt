We argue for extending the debate to driving behaviors in everyday road traffic where ubiquitous ethical questions arise due to the permanent redistribution of risk among road users. Using an interactive, graphical representation of different traffic situations, we measured participants’ preferences on driving maneuvers of AVs in a representative survey in Germany. How would people distribute risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic? The rich literature on the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs) revolves around moral judgments in unavoidable collision scenarios. Our participants’ preferences deviated significantly from mere collision avoidance. Interestingly, our participants were willing to take risks themselves for the benefit of other road users, suggesting that the social dilemma of AVs may be mitigated in risky environments. This distribution of risks raises ethically relevant questions that cannot be evaded by simple heuristics such as “hitting the brakes.” Our research might build a bridge between engineers and philosophers to discuss the ethics of AVs more constructively.
