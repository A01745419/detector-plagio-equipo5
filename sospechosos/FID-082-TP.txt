It is suggested by research that emotionally responsive machines, capable of simulating empathy, increase user acceptance towards them, as the feeling of affinity towards the machine reduces negative perceptual feedback. In order to endow a robot with emotional intelligence, it must be equipped with sensors capable of capturing users’ emotions (sense), appraising captured emotions to regulate its internal state (compute), and finally performing tasks where actions are regulated by the computed “emotional” state (act). However, despite the impressive progress made in recent years in terms of artificial intelligence, speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, and many other disciplines directly and indirectly related to artificial emotional recognition and behavior, we are still far from being able to endow robots with the empathic capabilities of a human being. An overview of the implications of introducing emotional intelligence in robotic constructions is aimed to be given by this article through discussing recent advances in emotional intelligence in robotics.
