Over the past few decades, there has been a steady surge in the number of vehicles traversing the roads, spurred by the burgeoning demand for urban mobility and the evolving landscape of contemporary logistics. Among the myriad of adverse consequences accompanying this vehicular proliferation, two prominent issues stand out: the escalation of traffic congestion and the surge in traffic accidents, both of which pose significant impediments to economic progress. However, these challenges can be effectively mitigated by imbuing vehicles with greater intelligence, thereby reducing their reliance on human intervention.
Throughout the annals of history, nations worldwide have embarked on extensive research endeavors aimed at ushering in the era of automated road vehicles. Presently, the quest for autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies has become a focal point for major automotive manufacturers across the globe. The inevitability of autonomous car adoption looms closer than anticipated, propelled by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Indeed, AI has emerged as a cornerstone in enabling AVs to perceive their surroundings acutely and execute informed decisions in real-time.
The evolution of AI owes much to the exponential growth of big data amassed from a plethora of sensing devices, coupled with the advent of cutting-edge computing resources. To comprehend the pivotal role of AI within AV systems, it is imperative to delve into the historical trajectory and development of artificial intelligence.
