Smart cities are characterized by the convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) with urban management to improve the quality of life of city dwellers. In this context, recommender systems, tools that offer personalized suggestions to city dwellers, have emerged as key contributors to this convergence. Their successful application in various areas of city life and their ability to process massive amounts of data generated in urban environments have accelerated their status as a crucial technology in the evolution of city planning. Our methodology involved the review of the Web of Science database, resulting in 130 articles that, after being filtered for relevancy, were reduced to 86. The first stage comprised the execution of a bibliometric analysis with the objective of analyzing structural aspects using the SciMAT tool. Subsequently, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 statement. The results depicted the different processes by which recommendations are filtered in areas such as tourism, health, mobility, and transport. This research is viewed as a significant breakthrough that can promote the evolution and efficiency of smart cities, establishing a solid framework for future research in this dynamic field.
