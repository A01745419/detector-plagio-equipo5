This paper primarily addresses the issue of asymmetric face recognition, where the number of names in a list may not match the number of faces in a photo, yet each face must be automatically matched with a corresponding name. The motivation for this problem stems from past scenarios where group photos were taken after meetings, but the provided participant list lacked individual labels. Additionally, some meeting attendees may have been involved in taking pictures and thus were not captured in the photos. To tackle this challenge, the paper introduces an asymmetric face recognition mechanism, abbreviated as AFRM. Initially, AFRM utilizes Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to detect and extract all faces from the photos. Subsequently, AFRM employs Convolution Feature Map (Conv_FF) to extract features from each face and categorize them into different classes. Then, a statistical-based mechanism is applied to associate each name in the list with the corresponding face class, effectively labeling each face. For quick face identification during meetings, AFRM utilizes K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to represent face features. In subsequent meetings, AFRM extracts the feature of a face and uses KNN to derive its features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves over 97% accuracy without requiring one-to-one name and face labeling.
