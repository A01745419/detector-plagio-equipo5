This article introduces a model for regulating moisture levels in historical structures, offering an adaptable solution. The proposed system is designed as a flexible IoT framework, incorporating a network of sensors to monitor indoor humidity levels and compare them with ground water levels, rainfall, and wind speed data to regulate the drying process. The control model, utilizing type-2 fuzzy logic reasoning, can dynamically adjust decisions based on water absorption rates. This innovative approach provides an intelligent system for managing interior conditions in historical buildings. The system was installed and evaluated in an old brewery building, demonstrating effective dehumidification at minimal expense according to research findings.
