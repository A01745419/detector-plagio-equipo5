Empathy computing is an emerging research field that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technology to predict, identify, simulate, and generate human empathy. This article critically reviews current research on empathy computing and discusses its future directions from a psychological perspective, with the aim of facilitating foundational research and practical applications in this field. This expansion raises novel questions about the universality of empathy and its potential evolution in human-computer interaction. It extends traditional studies on empathy in interpersonal relationships to explore its emerging manifestations in human-AI relationships. Empathy computing holds the promise of serving as a cornerstone for a unified theory of empathy that encompasses diverse relationship dynamics, ranging from human-human to human-machine interactions and beyond. It is beneficial for comprehensively understanding empathy and effectively promoting it in the context of an intelligent society. Although research on empathy computing is still in its early stages, it has shown potential for innovative applications in scenarios such as mental health, education, business services, and public management. Empathy computing represents a transformative frontier, not only providing methods to measure and analyze empathy automatically on a larger scale but also enriching the theoretical landscape of empathy research. With the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence, these fields, which involve substantial interpersonal interactions, are positioned to become the primary domains for human-computer interaction. Future research should focus on developing integrated theoretical models of empathy computing, establishing reliable psychological and behavioral datasets of empathy-related characteristics, and validating and refining empathy computing research through a human-centered approach. These four scenarios illustrate the vast potential applications of empathy computing. However, due to concerns related to safety and ethics, complete reliance on computers to perform empathetic tasks is currently not feasible. Instead, a collaboration between humans and computers is necessary. The current research on empathy computing can be categorized into four themes based on different purposes and methods. Empathy computing primarily aims to analyze and comprehend empathy using computers. Additionally, it facilitates policymakers to respond empathetically to citizens' needs and inquiries, thereby fostering trust between the government and the public. In public management, empathy computing can be used to generate empathetic discourse to counteract negative speech. Within the business sector, it enables organizations to deliver tailored customer experiences, thereby enhancing satisfaction and fostering loyalty through the generation of empathic dialogues. In the field of education, empathy computing can facilitate the learning process by employing empathetic AI tutors. In the realm of mental health, empathy computing can assist in automatically evaluating and enhancing therapists' empathetic abilities. The former provides users with a limited number of predefined rule-based responses and feedback to express empathy, while the latter utilizes AI to automatically generate a wide range of empathetic dialogues without relying on predefined rules. This endeavor can be further divided into two categories: (1) individual empathy assessment, which focuses on analyzing individual empathetic traits, and (2) empathetic content classification, which focuses on analyzing empathetic features in texts rather than individuals. Additionally, as research progresses, new directions will continue to emerge, such as improving the empathic capabilities of computers through brain-computer interface technology. The design of empathetic response systems and the development of generative empathetic dialogue systems are other areas of focus. Finally, this study tested the moderating role of visual cues (no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image) by conducting a moderated serial multiple mediation analysis. First, we employed an independent samples t-test to examine the effect of chatbots' conversational style on willingness to donate to Ukraine war victims. The results revealed that emotional chatbots yield a higher willingness to donate, and perceived humanness and empathy toward victims mediate this relationship independently and serially. Moreover, as research progresses, new directions will continue to emerge, such as improving the empathic capabilities of computers through brain-computer interface technology. This article provides a detailed overview of the latest advancements in these areas, showing how deep learning has greatly enhanced their abilities. Object detection in machine vision is a challenging area that requires significant improvements. While image classification accuracy is nearing 2.25%, surpassing human performance, object detection algorithms are still in the early stages. Current algorithms achieve only 40.8 MAPS on modern objects, so careful dataset selection is crucial for optimal results. Facial recognition is a well-established and popular field in Computer Vision, especially with advancements in deep learning and data sets. Deep facial recognition has made significant progress and is widely applied in real-world scenarios. A complete facial recognition system involves three main components: facial recognition, orientation, and representation. This system detects faces, aligns them to a standard view, and extracts features for recognition using deep convolutional neural networks. Charitable organizations are experiencing a global labor shortage. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been employed to help combat the shortage, however, the scope and limits of AI fundraisers are still unclear, calling for further investigation. The research approach used is qualitative by reviewing various studies and related literature. The data sources used are journals, articles, and books that are relevant to the research topic.
