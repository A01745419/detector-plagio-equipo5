With the rise of deep neural networks, the performance of biometric systems increased tremendously. Biometric systems for face recognition were used in everyday life, e.g., border control, crime prevention, or personal device access control. Although the accuracy of face recognition systems was generally high, they were not without flaws. Many biometric systems were found to exhibit demographic bias, resulting in different demographic groups not being recognized with the same accuracy. This was especially true for facial recognition due to demographic factors, e.g., gender and skin color. While many previous works already reported demographic bias, this work aimed to reduce demographic bias for biometric face recognition applications. In this regard, 12 face recognition systems were benchmarked regarding biometric recognition performance as well as demographic differentials, i.e., fairness. Subsequently, multiple fusion techniques were applied with the goal of improving the fairness in contrast to single systems. The experimental results showed that it was possible to improve the fairness regarding single demographics, e.g., skin color or gender, while improving fairness for demographic subgroups turned out to be more challenging.
