Artificial Intelligence (AI) had a revolutionary impact on our societies. It helped humans in facing the global challenges of this century. Traditionally, AI was developed in software or through neuromorphic engineering in hardware. More recently, a brand-new strategy was proposed. It was the so-called Chemical AI (CAI), which exploited molecular, supramolecular, and systems chemistry in wetware to mimic human intelligence. In this work, two promising approaches for boosting CAI were described. One regarded designing and implementing neural surrogates that could communicate through optical or chemical signals and give rise to networks for computational purposes and develop micro/nanorobotics. The other approach concerned “bottom-up synthetic cells” that could be exploited for applications in various scenarios, including future nano-medicine. Both topics were presented at a basic level, mainly to inform the broader audience of non-specialists, and so favored the rise of interest in these frontier subjects.
