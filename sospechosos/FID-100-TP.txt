Recently, researchers widely applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as expert systems (ES), fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and biologically inspired (BI) methods in power electronics and motor drives. Each AI method possesses its own uniqueness and characteristics. Researchers also developed a computational model of emotional learning in the mammalian brain, namely the brain emotional learning-based intelligent controller (BELBIC). The results indicate the ability of BELBIC to control unknown non-linear dynamic systems effectively. Therefore, researchers can easily adopt BELBIC for niche mechatronics and industrial applications.
