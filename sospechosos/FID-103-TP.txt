The study aims to explore the possibilities of multigenerational optimization of behavior control systems for agents of general artificial intelligence capable of independently solving a universal range of tasks in a real environment. It has developed the main principles of ontophylogenetic synthesis of control systems for agents of general artificial intelligence based on multi-agent neurocognitive architectures. It proposes methods and algorithms for synthesizing the phenotypes of control systems of intelligent agents according to their genotypes. Additionally, it has developed a software package for simulating the processes of ontophylogenetic synthesis of multi-agent neurocognitive architectures and conducted experiments to create phenotypes of intelligent agents based on them. It has developed a complex genome of an intelligent agent and established and substantiated the features of a multichromosome genetic algorithm for organizing calculations in the paradigm of multigenerational optimization of multi-agent neurocognitive architectures. The study demonstrates that multigenerational optimization of the multi-agent neurocognitive architecture of intelligent agents can contribute to achieving adaptive resistance to the operating conditions of a general artificial intelligence agent, provide the synthesis of its suboptimal structural and functional scheme, accelerate learning, and algorithms for finding solutions to a universal range of problems solved by this agent in its ecological niche.
