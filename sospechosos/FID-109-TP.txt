Artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as a pivotal aspect shaping the future of education, offering potential enhancements to teaching and learning processes, as well as the roles of educators and administrators. The integration of AI and robotics presents multifaceted challenges across social, pedagogical, practical, ethical, and equity dimensions within educational frameworks. Delving into discussions and instances of AI utilization in education, particularly within primary school settings, this analysis aims to elucidate the tangible ramifications of this significant educational paradigm shift. Notably, amidst these technological advancements, there looms the risk of exacerbating societal disparities unless equitable access is ensured. Emphasizing the potential for personalized learning trajectories, I will highlight primary school initiatives geared towards nurturing effective and collaborative communication skills, with a focus on recognizing, addressing, and preempting factors contributing to learning impediments. Finally, drawing a parallel to the historical evolution of traditional literacy (reading/writing), the necessity of introducing AI and robotics literacy courses for educators will be explored, aiming to facilitate broader adoption of these technologies across diverse age groups and academic levels.
