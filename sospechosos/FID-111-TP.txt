Utilizing gamification and video games represents a contemporary method for enhancing cognitive capabilities and refining managerial competencies, particularly strategic thinking skills. Numerous organizations across various sectors, including education, marketing, business, and entrepreneurship, have adopted video games for this purpose. This study sought to explore the role of video games in augmenting managers' strategic thinking abilities and their potential impact on cognitive skill development. The research cohort comprised 30 students actively engaged in the innovation and entrepreneurship sphere. Pisapia's strategic thinking questionnaire was employed to gauge participants' strategic thinking, while the CANTAB test was utilized to assess their cognitive capabilities. To discern individuals' gaming styles, indicators such as micro-management, planning, plan recognition, predictions, resource gathering, partial observability, and damage avoidance were devised. The results revealed that 53.3 percent of participants exhibited reflective thinking, 30 percent demonstrated systems thinking, while the remainder showcased a reframing thinking style as their dominant strategic thinking dimension. Additionally, a correlation was observed between damage avoidance criteria and reflective thinking style, alongside an inverse and significant correlation between resource gathering criteria and PRM test outcomes. This suggests that strategic games hold the potential to influence and even enhance cognitive functions such as attention, reaction, and memory, serving as valuable tools for cognitive enhancement. Accordingly, these games can be leveraged to design tasks aimed at bolstering managers' cognitive abilities, thereby fostering their strategic thinking and decision-making prowess.
